# Poke Breeder Bot

As long as the in-game preconditions are met before plugging in the device, plugging the Arduino directly into the switch through a USB Type B to USB Type C Cable should enable the bot to start picking up and hatching eggs automatically without any user input

## In-Game Information

### Preconditions

- You are not on your bike
- You are currently at the Nursery in the Wild Area
- There is an egg waiting for you at the Nursery
- Ensure that when you hit "X" the cursor is on the "Town Map" icon
- Your party is full of non-egg pokemon (The first pokemon will never be swapped out so it can be a flame body pokemon)
- None of the pokemon in your party are holding any items (except the first one, since it is never going to be swapped out it is allowed to hold an item)
- In-Game Options:
    - Text Speed: Fast
    - Send to Boxes: Manual
    - Give Nicknames: Don't Give
    - Vertical Camera Control: Regular
- It's recommended to direct your box to a series of empty boxes before beginning the automatic breeding process

### Breeding Duration Values

- Disclaimer: All of the breeding duration information including the `steps2breedingduration.py` script assume a party lead with flame body. If you do not use a flame body lead, then double the values

| Breeding Duration | Pokemon   | Cycles    | Steps | Cycling Time  |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------- | ----- | ------------- |
| 2250 (53 seconds) | Darumaka  | 20        | 5k    | 62 seconds    |
| 3500 (83 seconds) | Dreepy    | 40        | 10k   | 123 seconds   |

- To use the `steps2breedingduration.py` script type:

    `./steps2breedingduration.py <number of steps to hatch the egg>`

    Where the `number of steps to hatch the egg` is the value taken from this [link](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_Egg_cycles) in the far right column of the species of pokemon you are trying to hatch
- Change the `breeding_duration` variable at the bottom of `instructions.h` to match the value given as a result of running the `steps2breedingduration.py` script before making and flashing `Joystick.hex` to the Arduino

## Setting up the Arduino

- Disclaimer: These instructions were written for Mac OSX in the context of an Arduino with an atmega16u2 chip

### Dependencies and Compiling

- Install dfu-programmer through homebrew with:

    `brew install dfu-programmer`
- To compile this project you need AVR GCC Compiler and Tools. This can be installed through homebrew with:

    `brew tap osx-cross/avr`

    followed by

    `brew install avr-gcc`
- Download the LUFA library through this [link](http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php) and put it in this directory
- Make sure the `LUFA_PATH` inside the `makefile` points to the LUFA subdirectory that you just created inside this directory
- Ensure that the `makefile` setting for `MCU` is set to `MCU = atmega16u2` and compile by typing `make`

### Putting the Arduino in DFU Mode

- Plug the Arduino into a computer
- Put the Arduino in DFU mode if it is not already by bridging the reset pin with the ground
- If necessary, ensure the Arduino is in DFU mode by typing:

    `sudo dfu-programmer atmega16u2 get ID1`

### Flashing onto the Arduino

- Navigate to the folder containing the `.hex` file you are flashing onto the Arduino
- In this case, the `.hex` file to be flashed onto the Arduino is called `Joystick.hex` generated by the `makefile`
- Follow these commands to flash the `.hex` file:

    `sudo dfu-programmer atmega16u2 erase`

    `sudo dfu-programmer atmega16u2 flash <.hex file>`

    `sudo dfu-programmer atmega16u2 reset`

- If you receive this error:

    `dfu-programmer: no device present.`

    but your Arduino is plugged in and the lights are on then you most likely need to put the Arduino into DFU mode by bridging its reset and ground pins

### Additional Resources

- You can also use the automatic pokemon releasing bot [here](https://github.com/jonitram/clearboxesbot) for clearing your boxes of hatched eggs after you have finished hatching pokemon
